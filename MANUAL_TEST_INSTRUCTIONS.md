# Manual CLOB Testing Instructions

Since there seems to be a shell session issue, here are manual testing steps:

## Step 1: Compile Contracts
```bash
cd /Users/raghavareddy/Downloads/projects/crypto/legosfinance
npx hardhat compile
```

## Step 2: Deploy Enhanced CLOB (if needed)
```bash
npm run deploy:rise
```

## Step 3: Test Basic Connectivity
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/simple-clob-test.js --network riseTestnet
```

## Step 4: Test Full CLOB Functionality
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/test-clob.js --network riseTestnet
```

## Step 5: Test Frontend Integration

1. Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

3. Connect your wallet with the private key: `6ecae6e5a299ef53c052b592333c6f425931610e6ad6fea6ac050cb5ddb44338`

4. Test the following features:

### Order Book Features to Test:

#### A. Limit Orders:
1. Switch to "Limit" mode
2. Select "Lend" and place a lending order:
   - Asset: USDC
   - Amount: 100
   - Interest Rate: 5.0%
   - Duration: 30 days
   - Collateral Asset: WETH
   - Max LTV: 75%

3. Switch to "Borrow" and place a borrowing order:
   - Asset: USDC  
   - Amount: 50
   - Interest Rate: 6.0% (higher than lend rate)
   - Duration: 30 days
   - Collateral Asset: WETH
   - Collateral Amount: 0.1

#### B. Market Orders (Instant Execution):
1. Switch to "Market" mode
2. Test instant lend execution:
   - Asset: USDC
   - Amount: 25
   - Max Slippage: 1%

3. Test instant borrow execution:
   - Asset: USDC
   - Amount: 25  
   - Max Slippage: 1%
   - Collateral Asset: WETH
   - Collateral Amount: 0.05

#### C. Order Book Visualization:
1. Check the order book depth showing:
   - Lending orders (rates and amounts)
   - Borrowing orders (rates and amounts)
   - Real-time updates after order placement

#### D. Order Management:
1. View your active orders
2. Cancel pending orders
3. See order status changes (Pending ‚Üí Filled/Partially Filled)

## Expected Results:

### ‚úÖ Successful Instant Execution:
- Orders should match immediately when rates are compatible
- "InstantExecution" events should be emitted
- Toast notifications showing execution details
- Order book depth should update in real-time

### ‚úÖ Order Book Functionality:
- Orders appear in correct rate buckets
- Best rates are prioritized for matching
- Partial fills work correctly
- Order cancellation works

### ‚úÖ Market Orders:
- Execute immediately at best available rates
- Respect slippage limits
- Show execution details in UI

## Troubleshooting:

If you encounter issues:

1. **Compilation Errors**: Check the CLOB contract for syntax issues
2. **Network Issues**: Ensure you have testnet ETH for gas
3. **Token Issues**: Make sure test tokens are deployed and approved
4. **Frontend Issues**: Check browser console for errors

## Contract Addresses (Rise Testnet):

From your deployment:
- LEGOS Token: 0xaB10df16B55C82aa3d763A08ffec6953a835eeE2
- CLOB: 0xca3F8bc68E00FF11d6D89db25B8c553833a26eA7
- Risk Manager: 0xFc9A66238858D73D3f2b78Ca93F18c01E376454D
